# SNN-simulation

1. Simulation of behaviour of Lapicque neurons and modelling of Action Potentials as Gaussian Pulses for different types of inputs. 

2. Functions for plotting various phases and levels of membrane potential are added.

3. Spike communication from  action potential in axon hillock of upstream neuron to post synaptic cuurent accumulation in cell soma has been modelled as upholding biological 
   relevance.

4. Created functions for generating and visualizing custom made FFW SNN.

5. Noise study for rate encoded spike trains using AWGN.

More about the functions in details can be found in Functions.txt.
