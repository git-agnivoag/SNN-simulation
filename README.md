# SNN-simulation
Simulation of behaviour of Lapicque neurons and modelling of Action Potentials as Gaussian Pulses for different types of inputs. 
Functions for plotting various phases and levels of membrane potential are added.
Spike communication from  action potential in axon hillock of upstream neuron to post synaptic cuurent accumulation in cell soma has been modelled as upholding biological relevance.
Function for generating and visualizing custom made FFW SNN is also added.
